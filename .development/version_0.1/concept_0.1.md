## Concept

  > Connect is a platform that revolutionizes gaming by allowing any type of browser-capable device to be used as a display or controller.

- ### Registration and Role Assignment:

    - Display:
      Each session can be shown on one or more displays.

    - Controller:
      Smartphones or tablets can serve as game controllers.

    - Role Selection:
     Users choose on the landing page whether their device will act as a display or controller.

- ### Session Management:

  - Session Creation:
    A user creates a session and receives a QR code or link.

  - Session Joining:
    Others scan the QR code or use the link to connect.

  - Flexibility:
    Support for local, online, and mixed gaming modes.

- ### User-Friendliness:
  - Easy operation through QR codes and an intuitive, minimalist interface.

- ### Technical Implementation:

  - Web-App:
    Blazor/AvaloniaUI for the frontend, ASP.NET for the backend, SQLite as the database/manager.
    <!-- React/Angular für Frontend, Node.js/Express.js oder Django für Backend, PostgreSQL/MongoDB für Datenbank. -->

  - Mobile-App:
    Can be implemented with the same tech stack.
    <!-- React Native/Flutter für plattformübergreifende Entwicklung. -->
