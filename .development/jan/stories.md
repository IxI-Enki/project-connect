| **websocket**    | 01   | Connection | As a User, I want to connect my device to a shared session via WebSockets, so that I can see real-time visual updates (like background color changes) triggered by other connected devices.                                                                                                           | Multiple devices can connect to the same session using WebSockets within the same network. An action (e.g., button click) on one connected device triggers a visible change (e.g., background color update) on all other connected devices in near real-time.                                              | 3      |    3h      |
| **login**        | 02   | Session    | As a Session Creator, I want each joining user to have a unique identifier and limit the session to a maximum of 8 participants, so that I can manage players effectively and prevent duplicates.                                                                                                     | Each connected user is assigned a unique ID within the session. The system prevents more than 8 users from joining a single session. A user cannot join the same session with the same identifier simultaneously.                                                                                          | 2      |     3.5h    |
| **draw_cards**   | 03   | Game       | As a Player, I want to perform an action (like clicking a button) that results in drawing a card from a predefined stack and displaying it in my designated hand area on the screen, so that I can execute a basic game turn.                                                                         | A designated 'draw' action exists. Performing the action removes one card from a visible stack and adds it to the player's specific hand area on the display. This works reliably for a single player interacting with a stack.                                                                            | 3      |    2.5h       |
| **landing_page** | 04   | User       | As a New User accessing the platform, I want to see a clean landing page with clear options to either 'Set up a Display' or 'Join as a Controller', so that I can easily start hosting or joining a game session.                                                                                     | The application loads a landing page showing project identity/logo. Two distinct and clear interactive elements (e.g., buttons) exist: "Set up Display" and "Join as Controller". Clicking these initiates the respective workflows.                                                                       | 2      |            |
| **display**      | 05   | Display    | As a Host using the 'Display' option, I want the system to generate and show a unique session QR code and a corresponding shareable link, so that I can easily invite players ('Controllers') to join my session.                                                                                     | After selecting the "Set up Display" path, the screen shows a unique QR code and a text link. Both the QR code and link correspond to the same unique session identifier created on the backend.                                                                                                           | 3      |            |
| **controller**   | 06   | Controller | As a Player using the 'Controller' option, I want to be able to join a session by either scanning the Display's QR code using my device camera or by manually entering the session link, so that I can connect to the game.                                                                           | Selecting "Join as Controller" provides options to Scan QR or Enter Link. Scanning a valid session QR code successfully connects the device to that session. Entering a valid session link successfully connects the device to that session. Error handling for invalid codes/links.                       | 5      |            |
| **controller**   | 07   | Controller | As a Player connected as a 'Controller', I want my device screen to display a simple interactive element (e.g., an 'Action' button), so that I can trigger basic commands/inputs for the game displayed on the Host screen.                                                                           | Upon successfully connecting to a session, the Controller device displays a defined UI containing at least one interactive button. Pressing this button sends a specific, predefined command/event through the WebSocket connection (WS-01) to the backend/display.                                        | 5      |            |
| **random_deck**  | 08   | Game       | As a Host starting a card game session, I want the system to generate a standard 52-card deck, shuffled randomly, so that card games can be initiated fairly with unpredictable card distribution.                                                                                                    | A function exists that creates a standard 52-card deck (4 suits, 13 ranks). The order of cards in the generated deck is verifiably random (passes statistical randomness tests or uses a standard shuffling algorithm). This deck is available for use in the session.                                     | 3      |            |
| **ace_high**     | 09   | Game       | As a Player, I want to participate in a simple "Ace is High" game where each player draws one card (using draw_cards & controller) from a shared deck (random_deck), and the Display indicates the winner (player with the highest card, Ace high), so that we can test the end-to-end gameplay loop. | Host starts session (display). Multiple controllers join. Each player uses controller action  to draw one card from the randomized deck. Display shows cards drawn by each player. Display correctly identifies and indicates the winning player based on Ace > King > ... > 2 ranking.                    | 8      |            |
| **session**      | 10   | Backend    | As a Developer, I want the backend to reliably manage session lifecycles (creation, active state, termination) and handle the real-time message passing between Controllers and the Display, so that the user experience is stable and interactive.                                                   | Backend can create unique sessions. Backend routes messages from a specific Controller to the correct Display within the same session. Backend maintains session state while participants are connected. Basic handling for participant disconnection is implemented (e.g., session cleanup/notification). | 5      |            |
