# <p align="center"> 1. Initial Situation  </p>

*Once upon a time, the board and card games found in every household brought together people of all ages – and in today's digitally connected world, gaming has become one of the most popular leisure activities.*

By merging these concepts, we can bring back the familial atmosphere of game nights into living rooms and beyond.
Despite the significant advancements in gaming technology, there remain challenges that hinder a seamless gaming experience. Particularly noticeable are the limitations due to dependence on specific hardware and the complexity of setting up multiple devices for group play.

### Security Risks:
  - Using cloud services for gaming can lead to privacy issues since sensitive data such as game saves or personal information might be stored in the cloud.

	- Security vulnerabilities in device communication could also lead to unauthorized access or data breaches.

### Complexity Issues:
  - Configuring multiplayer mode often requires complex setups, which can be a barrier for users less familiar with technology.

	- The need to synchronize various platforms and devices can negatively impact the gaming experience.

### Dependence on Third Parties:
  - Many games require special devices like consoles and controllers, which incurs additional costs and dependencies on manufacturers or cloud services.

	- This reduces the control users have over their gaming experience and raises the barrier to entry for new players.

Our [analysis of the current market]() shows that the avaliable offerings often do not meet these requirements.

- **Expansion:** Gradually integrate open-source console emulators, one at a time, with community input on priority.

## **Technical Implementation:**
- **Web-App:** Blazor/AvaloniaUI for the frontend, ASP.NET for the backend, and a light/slim database/manager.
		<!-- React/Angular für Frontend, Node.js/Express.js oder Django für Backend, PostgreSQL/MongoDB für Datenbank. -->
- **Mobile-App:** Can be implemented with the same tech stack.
		<!-- React Native/Flutter für plattformübergreifende Entwicklung. -->

---

# <p align="center"> 3. Objectives/Goals  </p>
**Project Outline**

## Phase 1: Platform Creation

- **Onboarding and Connection:**
	- Develop a system for user onboarding and device/player connection.
		- **Simplicity & Accessibility**: The engine should be intuitive and easy to use for users of all ages.
		- **Platform Independence**: Games should run on any modern web browser without requiring installation or specialized hardware.

- **Own Emulator Introduction:**
	- Introduce an **own Emulator** for running popular family games, starting with card games like UNO and Schnapsen, followed by board games.
	- Emphasis on being uncomplicated and free.

- **Mobile Devices as Controllers/Game Pads:**
	- Smartphone and tablets can be registered as input devices since they are widely available and accessible to most users.

- **Flexible Display Options:**
	- Any internet-capable screen with a browser (e.g. SmartTVs, laptops, tablets, phones) can be used as a display for the game.

## Phase 2: Expansion to Open-Source Emulators

- **Integration of Open-Source Console Emulators:**
	- Gradually embed open-source emulators for various consoles, one at a time.
	- Establish a community-driven approach to decide the order of console inclusion.

- **ROM Library Management:**
	- Host-user provides a ROM - we check it against our library for authenticity.
	- If the ROM is an unaltered original, no upload of the entire rom is necessary, and we can instantly provide the game interface to both client and host users.
		> We won't store fully executable roms in our library, instead we provide the bulk of the rom-data from our servers and combine it with a fraction of the host-users rom.

### Phase 2b: Subscription for Advanced ROM Users

- **Subscription Model:**
	- Offer advanced users/creators the ability to upload "modified" ROMs to our servers.
	- These could be original games with altered gameplay mechanics ("hacked" titles) or entirely new, self-made games not previously available on our platform.
	- Requires additional server space for storage.

---

## Optimization for Multiplayer Scenarios

- **Couch Co-op**: Multiplayer, people in the same room play together.
- **Distant Multiplayer**: Players connect over the internet.
- **Multi-Screen**: Players can view different content on separate displays for innovative gameplay mechanics (e.g., active player, common area, opponent player).

## Technical Aspects and Expandability

- **Initial focus on Android + Chromium** for a quick development of a working prototype.
- **Possible future expansion to iOS + Safari** to reach a broader user-base.
- Use of modern web technologies to provide real-time interaction and synchronization.
