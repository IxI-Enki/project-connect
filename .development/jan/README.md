# Initial Situation
*Once upon a time, the board and card games found in every household brought together people of all ages â€“ and in today's digitally connected world, gaming has become one of the most popular leisure activities.*
By merging these concepts, we can bring back the familial atmosphere of game nights into living rooms and beyond.
Despite the significant advancements in gaming technology, there remain challenges that hinder a seamless gaming experience. Particularly noticeable are the limitations due to dependence on specific hardware and the complexity of setting up multiple devices for group play.

### Security Risks:
  - Using cloud services for gaming can lead to privacy issues since sensitive data such as game saves or personal information might be stored in the cloud.

  - Security vulnerabilities in device communication could also lead to unauthorized access or data breaches.

### Complexity Issues:
  - Configuring multiplayer mode often requires complex setups, which can be a barrier for users less familiar with technology.

  - The need to synchronize various platforms and devices can negatively impact the gaming experience.

### Dependence on Third Parties:
  - Many games require special devices like consoles and controllers, which incurs additional costs and dependencies on manufacturers or cloud services.

  - This reduces the control users have over their gaming experience and raises the barrier to entry for new players.

Our [analysis of the current market](https://github.com/IxI-Enki/project-connect/tree/master/.development/jan#current-market-situation) shows that the avaliable offerings often do not meet these requirements.
A system that offers the flexibility to use any internet-capable device as a display or controller to connect people easily could therefore represent a revolution in gaming by breaking down barriers to accessibility, user-friendliness, and security.
