| PC-Onboard-001 |  01   | User Onboarding | As a new user, I want to see a clear project logo and name displayed prominently on the landing page.         | The landing page loads quickly and displays the defined project logo in the center and the project name clearly above or below it.                                                                                                                                                           |   2    |      2h      |
| PC-Onboard-002 |  01   | User Onboarding | As a new user, I want to see two distinct and clearly labeled buttons: 'Use as Display' and 'Use as Controller'. | Two large, easily tappable/clickable buttons with the text 'Use as Display' and 'Use as Controller' are positioned centrally on the landing page, making their purpose immediately obvious.                                                                                             |   3    |      3h      |
| PC-Onboard-003 |  01   | User Onboarding | As a new user, I want to see a concise introductory text explaining the core concept of using any device to play games. | A brief paragraph (2-3 sentences) welcomes users and explains that this platform allows using different devices as screens and controllers for games, highlighting ease of use and accessibility.                                                                                         |   2    |      2h      |
| PC-Display-001 |  01   | Display Mode  | As a user choosing 'Display', I want the system to generate a unique, short, and easy-to-read session ID.   | Upon clicking 'Use as Display', the system generates a random, alphanumeric session ID (e.g., ABC-123) and displays it clearly on the screen.                                                                                                                                             |   4    |      5h      |
| PC-Display-002 |  01   | Display Mode  | As a user choosing 'Display', I want the system to generate a scannable QR code representing the session ID.  | Alongside the session ID, a QR code is generated dynamically, encoding the session ID for easy scanning by controller devices. The QR code is clearly visible and scannable.                                                                                                                    |   5    |      6h      |
| PC-Display-003 |  01   | Display Mode  | As a display user, I want to see clear instructions on how others can join my session using the QR code or link. | Below the session ID and QR code, concise instructions are provided, such as "Scan the QR code with your phone or tablet" and "Enter the link [short link URL] in your browser".                                                                                                             |   3    |      3h      |
| PC-Control-001 |  01   | Controller Mode | As a user choosing 'Controller', I want to see a button to access my device's camera for QR code scanning. | Clicking 'Use as Controller' presents a prominent button (or area) labeled 'Scan QR Code', which, when pressed, requests camera access (if not already granted) and activates the scanner.                                                                                                  |   5    |      7h      |
| PC-Control-002 |  01   | Controller Mode | As a user choosing 'Controller', I want to see an input field where I can manually enter a session short link. | Below or next to the QR code scanner, there is a clearly labeled input field where users can type in the session short link provided by the display user, along with a 'Join' button.                                                                                                           |   4    |      5h      |
| PC-Control-003 |  01   | Controller Mode | As a controller user, I want to receive visual feedback (e.g., a loading indicator) while attempting to join a session. | When a user initiates joining a session (via QR scan or link entry), a visual indicator (e.g., spinning circle, progress bar) is displayed to show that the connection process is underway.                                                                                          |   3    |      4h      |
| PC-Control-004 |  02   | Controller UI   | As a connected controller in UNO, I want to see a visual representation of my hand (the cards I hold).   | Once connected to an UNO session, the bottom of the controller screen displays graphical representations of the cards dealt to the player. The cards should be easily identifiable.                                                                                                            |   8    |     10h      |
| PC-Control-005 |  02   | Controller UI   | As a connected controller in UNO, I want to have interactive buttons to play a selected card from my hand. | When a card in the user's hand is selected (e.g., by tapping), a prominent 'Play Card' button appears or becomes enabled, allowing the user to attempt to play the chosen card.                                                                                                             |   7    |      9h      |
| PC-Control-006 |  02   | Controller UI   | As a connected controller in UNO, I want to have a button to draw a card if I cannot play a card.          | A clearly labeled 'Draw Card' button is visible on the controller screen during the player's turn when they cannot or choose not to play a card from their hand.                                                                                                                            |   5    |      6h      |
| PC-Display-004 |  02   | Display Game    | As a connected display in UNO, I want to see the cards played by each player in a designated area.       | The main game area on the display shows the discard pile with the currently active card and indicates which player played it.                                                                                                                                                               |   6    |      8h      |
| PC-Display-005 |  02   | Display Game    | As a connected display in UNO, I want to see the number of cards each connected player has.               | The display shows an indicator for each connected player, displaying their name (initially a generic identifier like 'Player 1', 'Player 2') and the number of cards currently in their hand.                                                                                                 |   5    |      6h      |
| PC-Session-001 |  03   | Session Mgmt    | As the host, I want a clear button labeled 'Start Game' to initiate the UNO game once enough players have joined. | On the display interface, once at least two controllers are connected in an UNO session, a 'Start Game' button becomes visible and enabled for the host to begin the gameplay.                                                                                                               |   3    |      4h      |
| PC-Session-002 |  03   | Session Mgmt    | As any connected user, I want to see a clear indication of whose turn it is during the UNO game.         | The display clearly highlights the current player's turn, either by visually emphasizing their player indicator or by displaying a message like "It's [Player Name]'s turn."                                                                                                               |   4    |      5h      |
| PC-Session-003 |  03   | Session Mgmt    | As the host, I want to have a button labeled 'End Session' to terminate the current game and disconnect all players. | The display interface includes a clearly labeled 'End Session' button that, when clicked by the host, ends the current game, disconnects all connected controllers, and returns the display to a pre-game state.                                                                         |   4    |      5h      |
| PC-Connect-001 |  03   | Connection Logic| As a user, I want to receive an error message if I try to join a session that does not exist or is full. | If a controller user attempts to join a session with an invalid ID or if the session has reached its maximum player capacity (initially define a reasonable limit for UNO), a clear and informative error message is displayed on the controller device.                                   |   7    |     10h      |
| PC-Emulator-001 |  04   | Own Emulator - Core Logic | As a developer, I want the UNO emulator to handle the dealing of initial hands to each player.        | At the start of a new UNO game, the emulator randomly deals a predetermined number of cards (e.g., 7) from a standard UNO deck to each connected player. This initial distribution should be fair and consistent.                                                                     |   10   |     15h      |
| PC-UI-Basic-001 |  05   | Basic UI Styling | As a user, I want the text elements (session ID, instructions, button labels) to be clearly readable with sufficient contrast. | All text elements on the landing page, display interface, and controller interface have adequate contrast against their background color, ensuring readability for users with different visual abilities. Standard font sizes are used for key information.                                   |   3    |      4h      |
